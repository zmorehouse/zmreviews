        <p> Although I can‘t say I’m the biggest fan of Horror
            films, Psych-Thriller’s are my jam. I think there’s
            more substance in Thrillers - more intention
            behind their content than simply to scare, and
            ‘Last Night in SoHo’ does just this. <br><br>Edgar Wright’s take on a modern-day Hitchcock
            film marks some of his finest work since the Baby
            Driver. Featuring some incredible sequencing,
            jaw-dropping camera work,delightful colour
            grading and VFX and, in true EW fashion, a slue of
            eerie 60’s songs, ‘Last Night in SoHo’ is one of the
            most beautiful new-age thriller movies to date.

            Before I go any further, I dont think the trailer
            does this film justice - so if you plan on
            watching it, please go in blind.<br><br>
            The film follows Eloise, a fashion student that’s
            recently moved to the big city to persue her
            dream of becoming a designer. <br><br>
            
            However, after finding herself struggling to adjust to life in London, she finds herself being
            entranced by the dreamscape of SoHo - a late 60’s interpretation of the suburb she resides
            in and begins to live vicariously through Sandy, a wannabe celebrity from the time period.
            <br><br>
            I wont give you too much more, for scare of spoiling the film, however I did want to talk
            about some of the camera work and finer editing here. As I spoke about before, Eloise
            begins to live through the persona of Sandy. This is made obvious at the beginning of her
            nightly interactions, where she looks in the mirror and sees herself as the character.<br><br>However, this
            motif is constantly interpreted through the entire film. Hardly visible
            reflections of Sandy have been changed to Eloise - be it in the raindrops on the car window,
            or the cocktail shaker at the bar. These small details are incredibly effective in building this
            intimate relationship between the two and are a testimate to Edgar Wrights creative
            vision.<br><br>Furthering this intimacy is the pacing of the film. In true Hitchcock fashion - it‘s a bit of
            a
            slow burn. For the first half an hour of the film, you don’t realiseyou’re watching a thriller.
            This isn’t to say it’s bad, but the opposite. It does a phenomenal job of developing close
            relationships between it’s characters before inevitably descending into chaos.
            <br><br>
            The acting talent doesn’t dissapoint either, with Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomasin McKenzie and
            Matt Smith doing a phenomenal job of lending themselves to their characters, with the
            set design of 60’s London again reinforcing the acid-trip esque direction of Wright.
            <br><br>
            My biggest critique lies within some of the not-so-subtleties. The film is somewhat
            predictable, meaning a good chunk of viewers will guess the twist 20 minutes before it
            happens. The film is almost flawless, however the obvious foreshadowing and exposition
            (paired with some repetitive themes) detracts from the overall thrill of the film and it’s
            climax. Still, it’s a great watch - so give it a crack, and let me know what you think!
