            This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to
            find your elements. Do not name this page anything other than
            assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and
            mark your assignment elements.

          <h2><b>1.0 Part 1 Tasks</b></h2>
          <h2>
            <b>1.2 Your <i>Me and My Passion</i></b>
          </h2>
          <p><a href="/index.html">Link To Me and My Passion</a></p>
          <p>This website looks to be a place to showcase my movie reviews.</p>
          <p>I've looked to design this website in an editorial style, being inspired by the likes of Pitchfork and Vogue. As a result, I opted for a greyscale color pallette, being mixed alongside some colorful imagery and a pairing of both Serif and Sans-Serif fonts. Sharp edges and justified text help reinforce this.
          </p>
          <p>Please note that the reusable sections of the site (header and footer) have been built through /scripts.js. I was conflicted whether to do this, as the response on my forum post (below) indicated I was allowed to, whereas David's post indicated I couldn't. I left this in, however didn't implement any other Javascript (and will wait for p2 & p3 to continue) </p>
          <p>Please also view the website in a 1920 * 1080 desktop ratio. I have yet to add media commands (which will be added in p3)</p>
          <h2><b>1.3 CSS</b></h2>

            <a href="/index.html">Link to Homepage (being styled by the above)</a> </p>
          <p>Notes : Styles.css is used for global styling, alongside each page having a respective css file. I have linked both my styles.css and homepage.css files as they have both been used to create the front page of my website.</p>

          <p>Notes: There are two forms currently on the website - one at the bottom of the homepage and on the 'Feedback' page. The page linked above is the 'Feedback' page, featuring both the form alongside some links for users to contact me directly. (Socials and Email)</p>

          <p> Again, the site works best on a 1920*1080 desktop ratio. Media commands will be added in part 3 as 'Alternative CSS'. </p>

          <p><a href="/imagemap.html">Link To Image Map</a></p>
