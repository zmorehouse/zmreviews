    <p>
        G'day, I'm Zac. I’m an amateur videographer and film critic, with a love for all things digital media… and
        you’ve arrived at my site.
        <br><br>
        I’ve been writing film reviews for a few years now and decided this website would be a great spot to showcase
        them. Inspired by the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KarstenRunquist" target=_blank>Karsten
            Runquist</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThomasFlight" target=_blank>Thomas Flight</a>, I like to
        review and analyse film and TV, in a way that feels relaxed and authentic.
        <br><br>
        Though I don’t consider my opinions to hold much weight - my love for cinema, alongside my enjoyment of
        analytical writing, has proven watching and reviewing films to be one of my greatest passions. I truly do
        consider cinema to be one of the most incredible artforms and am excited to exhibit my love for the medium to as
        many people as possible.
        <br><br>
        Outside of film, I’m currently a full-time student at ANU, studying a Bachelor of Arts (Digital Humanities). I
        enjoy music, video games and design and am currently employed in the UI and UX design space. I’d like to
        continue sharpening and refining not only my design but my development skills to continue this career pathway in
        the future.
        <br><br>
        So, have a browse! I hope you enjoy your time here.
