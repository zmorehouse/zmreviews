        ‘Eternals’ was the first Marvel film I skipped 
        watching in cinemas since ‘Guardians : Volume 2’
        and, by sheer coincidence, it turned out to be what
        I consider as the worst attempt at a MCU movie to 
        date. 
        <br><br>
        Like, this thing was bad. So bad, I’d rather have 
        marathoned ‘The Hulk, Thor : TDW and Captain 
        Marvel’ then sit through this 2 and a half hour peice 
        of overproduced garbage.
        <br><br>
        It may be a bias. I might be too critical comparing 
        the film with the mastery of ‘Shang-Chi’ and ‘No Way 
        Home’ although I’m genuinely baffled how the same
        studio can produce these two works of art and 
        whatever ‘Eternals’ is within the same year.
        <br><br>

        Online, the film has been moderately recieved, 
        scoring a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and though
        that might be low for a MCU film - I think that 
        score is still being too generous.
        <br><br>

        Poor acting, plotholes that would put Cinema
        Sins to shame, disingenous and bland writing, 
        all mesh together to create this discombobulated 
        peice of frankly offensive cinema.
        <br><br>

        We’re first introduced to a plethora of characters, where I think is where Eternals makes’ the first 
        of it’s many mistakes - too many characters and not enough fucks to give about them. Unlike 
        your typical cast films, such as ‘Oceans 11’, or better yet - Marvel’s own ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ 
        Eternal’s fails to characterise their cast in enough depth that they come across as memorable.
        <br><br>

        Dialogue between the characters seem forced and disingenuous with the film failing to 
        develop any sort of interpersonal relationships among the cast. I think films like Guardians work
        because of the way the writer focuses in on Star Lord and his relationships with the others, 
        whilst still managing to consistently develop the lives of the other Guardians. Eternal’s doesnt 
        do this - and it results in the characters of the film being extremely disinteresting and having
        next to no progression through the movies runtime.
        <br><br>

        Furthermore, the film is shrouded in this obsession to remove itself from the ‘Marvel Forumla’ -
        all in the meantime adopting these age-old superhero tropes from other films that the MCU has 
        purposefully neglected in the past. If you removed all mention of ‘Thanos’ and sat me to watch 
        this movie, I would’ve thought it was either an indpendent studio behind it - or the third cut of
        Justice League. Unfortunantely, it doesn’t seem like Chloé Zhao know’s if she want’s this film to
        be a ‘Shang Chi’ or another ‘Nomadland’.
        <br><br>

        To make things worse positive views on this film come across as even more elitest than the
        negative ones - and that’s coming from a guy (with little to no film experience) that just called
        a film with a $200 million budget ‘offensive’.
        <br><br>

        The film is praised for it’s ‘diverse cast’ (even though the writing fails to create a genuine 
        relationship with any of them). It’s held on a high pedestal for being more ‘dark and mature’ even 
        though it makes the film feel dull and agonisingly slow (contrasting your MCU expectations)
        <br><br>

        Unfortunantely I’m running out of space, however on the lighter side, the VFX are pheonemal 
        (as usual) and the actors do their best to work with the bad writing. I hate to be a debbie downer,
        but this film just didn’t hit where it needed to, although I implore you to watch it and tell me your
        opinions, personally however, I think i’ll be placing it in the same boat as the Incredible Hulk, and
        giving it a miss in my next MCU Marathon.
