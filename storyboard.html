                Hi there, I'm Zac. I'm an amateur videographer and film critic and I love movies.
                <br><br>
             
                And, most importantly - welcome to my website! 
                <br><br>
            
                As you’ve probably already figured out, this website is where I share my love for cinema with the world - hosting a number of reviews, a list of my favourite films and some other fun stuff! This video looks to dive into a bit more ‘about me’ than simply what's to your right - discussing my background in film, my reviewing process and some further plans for the website, looking to expand my catalogue. 
                <br><br>

                So, why movies?
                I've been passionate about film since I was a kid - it’s a generic answer but I've always been fascinated by how a piece of media can have such a profound emotional impact on individuals. As a kid, this was as deep as sobbing when Lightning McQueen lost his piston cup race - but, as I got older, I started to develop a deeper appreciation for the craft of filmmaking - and its ability to explore complex themes and ideas like no other piece of media. I became increasingly interested in the technical aspects of filmmaking, such as cinematography, sound design, and editing, and started to explore different genres and styles to broaden my understanding of the medium. Ultimately, my passion for film stems from the way it can connect us with each other and with our own emotions, and I feel fortunate to be able to share that passion with others through my reviews and analysis.
                <br><br>

                My reviewing process?
                Ultimately, films are highly subjective. What resonates with one viewer may not resonate with another, and that's what makes film so intriguing. I believe, there is a film out there for everyone that resonates with them on a personal level. My main goal with these reviews is to help people uncover these films and find something that they love.
                <br><br>

                When it comes to reviewing movies, I have a loose structure that I follow. I believe that a film can be broken down into three key components: themes, performances, and cinematography. I try my best to assess each of these elements in my reviews but, with a medium as diverse as film, there are hundreds of other factors that can make or break a film. From pacing and editing to music and chemistry between actors, there are countless elements that can affect how a movie is received.
                <br><br>

                Although it's impossible to cover every aspect of a film in a single review, I strive to touch on the elements that stand out to me the most - in turn, hoping to provide readers with a general sense of whether or not the film is worth their time. 
                This website and its contents
                I’ve been reviewing movies casually for a number of years now, primarily through posts on Instagram. A selection of these reviews has since been migrated to this website, so feel free to go and give them a look! Moreso, I’ve also briefly indulged in some short video essay-style content and, though I’m yet to create any about movies in particular when the time comes - I’d love to add them to this site too.
                <br><br>

                Outside of film, I also love video games and music - and really anything digital media. These are areas I’d also enjoy giving a crack at reviewing in the future so who knows, maybe there’ll be a couple more categories on the site! Professionally, I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Arts (Digital Humanities) at the Australian National University. Before this, I was studying a Bachelor of Communications (Screen Media) at the University of Wollongong last year. While I was there, I had the opportunity to work on various projects within the screen media industry, such as logo design, filmmaking, and immersive media. These experiences have given me a great insight into the diverse and exciting world of screen media, and have fueled my passion for creating and designing within this field. 
                <br><br>

                Anyways - that's mostly it for now. Give the site a browse and maybe check out some of my reviews! You can also find me on Twitter, Letterboxd and Instagram. I’ll see you next time and leave you with a couple more of my favourite shots!
