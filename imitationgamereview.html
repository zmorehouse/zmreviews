        <p> Showcasing arguably one of Benedict Cumber
            batch’s best acting performances to date, ‘The
            Imitation Game’ is a dramatic retelling of the life
            of Alan Turing, his role as a WW2 crypto analysist
            and the way through which the ‘Enigma Machine’<br><br>(a German encription device) was cracked.

            The film, although criticized for being somewhat
            historically innacurate, is still a brilliant watch.
            <br><br>
            Even though it’s not centred around the front of
            the war, the film finds itself shrouded in drama
            and suspense whilst simultaneously acting as
            somewhat of an expository Britain’s best kept
            secrets.
            <br><br>
            It’s a gripping story that, when placed alongside
            the constant horrors of WW2 effectively places
            focus upon the importance of deciphering
            the machine.<br><br>
            At the end of the day though, I believe it’s within
            the characterisation of Alan Turing, where the
            film really makes it’s mark.

            <br><br>
            The film not only follows the decryption of the Enigma Machine, but the life struggles of
            Alan - as he copes with social ineptsy, a lack of companionship, and his battle with his
            sexuality (a theme that I believe should have been explored further in depth by the
            filmmakers, but I digress)<br><br>Clever editing is constantly throwing us between time periods, juxtaposing
            the glory days
            of Turing and his achievements with some of the lowest parts of his life. The film, in
            conjunction with the acting talents of Cumberbatch, does a pheonomenal job of illustrating
            Turing as this extremely sour, arrogant and unlikeable character, whilst continually stoking
            the audiences inner patriotic flame just enough that you’ll cheer him on anyway.
            <br><br>
            Time and time again, I found myself rooting for this ignatious asshole to crack the
            ‘uncrackable’ cypher... as much as I failed to like Alan’s character. This is not only credit to
            Cumberbatch as a phenomenal actor, however the overall writing of the film.<br><br>
            I think it’s within this style of writing is where the film really shines. It contrasts this
            magnificent war effort, with these 6 arrogant nerds sitting in a room - and does so in such a
            way that forces them to feel more impactful to the end of the war than the thousands
            of soldiers on the front-line (which becomes essentially true).<br><br>
            The writing is snappy and sharp, whilst still maintaining this consistent aura of secrecy. The
            set design furthers this, appearing as somewhat vague and mysterious whilst still doing a
            brilliant job of setting the scene. <br><br>Overall, I think the film is a great watch - especially for
            someone who is mostly unphased
            by a prioritisation of gripping and dramatic story over historical accuracy, and although
            I think there are pieces it could’ve expanded apon, I still definitely recommend it.
