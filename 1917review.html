        <p> Although 1917 is a film that’s been consistently
            praised for its editing and creative direction, it
            took me a suprisingly long while for me to bump it
            to the front of my watchlist. A film presented in 
            one-take is impressive, but a war movie? It’s unheard 
            of. And yet,my distaste for the War genre led me to
            prioritise a number of other films over this one time 
            and time again. 
            <br><br>
            However, after watching 1917 and
            promptly adding it to my list of all-time ‘must 
            watchs’ I can see just what I was missing out on with
            that type of mindset (more on that later).
            1917 is a peice of art. It’s a captivating piece of 21st
            century media, and it’s something that’s set the
            bar for the creative implications of both film post
            production, and incredible writing for years to come.
            <br><br>
            The film follows two WW1 soldiers, and their 
            journey across No Man’s Land, to deliver a message
            that, if not delievered, will essentially lead thousands
            of soldiers, including the protagonists brother, to
            their deaths.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, the film’s post production is to die for - and why wouldn’t it be. Lee Smith, the lead
            editor (up the Aussies!), has a plethora of flims under his belt, including Inception, the
            Dark Night, Dunkirk and Interstellar to name a few. Cleverly hidden cuts pair well with the
            choiceful choreography of the camera to make for an incredibly entertaining watch. It’s
            furthered still by an acute use of colour grading and special effects - that make nearly
            every frame of the film worthy of being framed and hung in a museum.
            <br><br>
            Assisting this, the writing of the film is incredible. It blew my mind that, though the film is
            framed in one shot, the movie never felt slow. There was always something happening, 
            whether it be a German bomber appearing from across the fields, a lone sniper deciding
            it’s time to open fire or simply a light-hearted interation between the soldiers, ‘1917’ always
            stayed fresh. Even when the pacing of the film slowed down - there was this consistent
            looming intensity in the air, that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire runtime.
            <br><br>
            Scenes change in an instant, the story shifts and bends as our protagonists progress and 
            the movie never ceases to stop giving. Obviously, the music production, choice of actors, 
            cinematography, set design and overall historical accuracy are also out of this world.
            <br><br>
            But, for me personally, I think ‘1917’ has given me something even further - something it
            may have not even intended to. I don’t care for war movies - or at least, I didn’t. They feel
            generic and sloppy, they feature dull portrayals of historical events to make a quick buck.
            <br><br>
            But after enjoying 1917 so much, it makes it clear how narrow-minded that mindset is.
            <br><br>
            It’s the age old saying, dont judge a book by its cover... or movie by it’s synopsis. It doesn’t
            matter what genre a film is, or what it’s about. If the movie is good, it shouldn’t matter.
            Anything featuring such artistry as ‘1917’ - such expert direction and creative vision is worth
            watching.<br>
