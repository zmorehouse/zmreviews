        <p> I’d be lying if I said i wasn’t going into
            “Don’t Look Up” without high hopes and
            although Netflix originals have the
            reputation of being very hit-or-miss, from
            my point of view this film felt like it
            couldn’t go wrong. A starstudded cast
            headed by the likes of Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer
            Lawrence and Timothee Chalamet paired
            with an armageddon-esque storyline.
            <br><br>What I had failed to realise beforehand
            however, was the fact that this isn’t
            a drama or a thriller. It’s a comedy satire -
            largely focused on real world politics and
            the firm grasp of social media, capitalism
            and corruption around current day America.
            <br><br>
            Don’t get me wrong, I love a good satire,
            however for a satire to effectively get it’s
            point across - it needs to have a clear goal
            in mind, and it doesn’t feel like “Don’t Look
            Up” does.
            <br><br>
            It’s too ambitious. The film is so chock-a-block with this obnoxious, straight to the point,
            comedic satire that it fails to actually get a point across. Let’s satirise social media, oh?
            Now we’re discussing Kid Cudi and fame culture. We’re jumping across now to Climate
            deniers - and, speak of devil, here’s a representation of the Trump Administration.<br><br>Don’t get me
            wrong. I appreciate what they’re trying to do - and it’s clear from the
            final dinner table scene that “Don’t Look Up’s” overall goal is to tackle this overaching
            human cynicism that’s consistently being made more apparent within society as we
            progress. But it’s so obvious, so forcefully stuffed into the writing and editing, that it doesn’t
            let the film breath. It’s frustrating - because I feel that stripping back these references
            would’ve made the film MORE watchable and digestable - rather than turning out how
            it has - two hours of non-stop ineffective satirical social commentary. <br><br> Obviously, aside from the
            overarching theme of the movie. It’s completely watchable.
            The acting, is of course, incredible - with Leo absolutely nailing the role of the nerdy
            anxious scientist, and Jennifer fitting suprisingly well into her given part. Jonah Hill
            does well as a bit of comedic relief, Chalamet is completely welcome and Meryl Streep
            is in her element. We also see Kid Cudi and Ariana Grande, and although they’re quite
            humorous - they’re often overshadowed by this annoying ‘fame culture sucks and here’s
            why’ message that the writers are trying to cram down our throats. Although the film
            feels sluggish at times - it‘s often saved by some well thought out jokes or the occasional
            piece of well-timed tension. <br><br>Overall, the film is perfectly fine - and it might by my fault for
            coming into it not knowing
            what it really was. But at the end of the day - “Don’t Look Up” feels like a pizza with too
            much on it. Sure, it’s fine - but holy shit, I think a simple Pepperoni would’ve been nicer.
